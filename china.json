During “WW2”, Sichuan Clique was mostly organized and in agreement. During the war, data shows that of all the numbers of dead or injured soldiers 2.24 of the 3.26 million were from Sichuan Clique. Three of the nine NRA generals that died in the war were also from the province. While the men were reported to be very brave, they had limited combat experience and during the Warlord Era they were known for being poorly trained even by Chinese Warlord Era standards. The province also had limited access to factories or machine guns. They were so lacking in supplies, that many of them men didn't have boots, only straw sandles",

American police officers within special camps, would train Chinese guerrillas in the use of radios, spying, identifiying enemy equipment, hand to hand fighting, small arms, explosives, and sabotages.

While maybe half or less of the soldiers of the NRA had a good uniform, boots, and a rifle; the average soldier in service to Yan Xishan could've had spares. Every single one of these men was born in their province and some of them had lived their whole lives with Yan Xishan in power, hearing people repeat his speeches, and reading his newspapers. They spent the time they didn't spend training, building roads, and helping farmers, which made them very popular with many ordinary people. While it's not clear how well the average soldier of Yan Xishan understood the man's seemingly complex blend of every single modern European and ancient Chinese philosophy, the warlord claimed to practice a philosophy of service, modernity, and equality. At the very least, the average soldier would notice the 'land reforms' and how many of the corrupt elite seemed to despise Yan Xishan.",

Even Mao wasn't sure if he wanted to refer to Yan Xishan's thinking as 'suicidal tactics' or praise him for waging complete resistance with no surrender. Yan Xishan's best men were at times better equipped than the Japanese, and were heavily motivated by: better treatment, better living conditions, Yan Xishan's appearance of being a complex and intelligent philosophical leader, seemingly endless automatic weapons, and the fact that Yan Xishan would personally order the execution of commanders he thought were cowardly. According to some reports, for every one of them that died, they took as many as two, three, four, or even five Japanese.",

'Yen was equipping his troops with a locally produced copy of the Thompson sub machine gun, chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge, but was experiencing supply difficulties as his troops' sidearms were 7.63mm caliber C96 handguns. Yan's solution was to produce a .45 ACP caliber version of the C96, thus standardizing ammunition and making supply logistics easier. Designated Type 17, production of the .45 caliber handgun began in 1929 at the Taiyuan Arsenal and ended in 1931. They are inscribed (in Chinese) '17' on the left hand side of the gun, and 'Republic Year Eighteen, Made in Shansi' on the right hand side. They were issued (along with Thompson SMGs) to railway guards in the province as defense against bandits and other warlords.",
